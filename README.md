# Stat 325 Final Project

We aim to analyze gene expression data from brain tumors and “normal” (benign) brains to predict cancer, predict brain cancer presence vs absence (normal brain), predict type of brain cancer (4 subtypes + normal brain), and identify which genes are most informative for predicting cancer and each cancer subtype
